configs:
  Configuration files containing settings for packaging kernels.

  Naming convention:
    variant-socflavour-version.cfg

    The variant- field is optional, if empty then the kernel probably comes from
    linux-linaro. There are currently two variants, lt means the source is a landing
    team kernel.  A variant of llt means the source comes from linux-linaro-tracking.

    The socflavour is self explanatory however sometimes a board name is used as in
    the origen kernels.

    The version should be just two digits like 3.4, 3.5 etc however the kernel can be a
    release candidate (-rcN) or a stable kernel (3.4.47).

    At the time of the last update to this README the configs were:

      llt-omap-3.4.cfg
      llt-origen-3.4.cfg
      lt-omap-3.4.cfg
      lt-origen-3.5.cfg
      lt-vexpress-3.5.cfg
      origen-3.5.cfg
      vexpress-3.5.cfg

  Contents:
    Here is an example config for an origen 3.7 kernel using the linux linaro kernel.
    The comment lines are not in the actual file and are here to serve as annontaton.

	#!/bin/bash
	export kernel_repo=git://git.linaro.org/kernel/linux-linaro-tracking.git
	export kernel_branch=linux-linaro
	export board_config_repo=$kernel_repo
	export board_config_branch=$kernel_branch
	export board_config_frags="linaro/configs/origen.conf"
	export distribution=quantal
	export linaroconfigsboardflavour=origen
	export linaro_ubuntu_packaging_repo=git://git.linaro.org/ubuntu/linux-linaro-raring.git
	export linaro_ubuntu_packaging_branch=linaro-ubuntu-packaging-3.7
	export nearby_git=~/reference-git
	export SAMPLEBOARDS=origen
	export SOCFAMILY=ORIGEN
	export SOCFLAVOUR=origen
	export SOCVENDOR=Samsung
	export ubuntu_and_base_config_repo=$kernel_repo
	export ubuntu_and_base_config_branch=$kernel_branch
	export ubuntu_config_frag=linaro/configs/ubuntu.conf

scripts:
  package_kernel -- a script that will package a kernel using info from env vars likely
    setup by a script like those in configs
  filtersauce -- maintenance script for creating the linaro-ubuntu-packaging trees

usage:
  Create your own config using an existing one as starting point.  Then run the package_kernel
  script:
	~/work/git-trees/ubuntu-kernel-ci/ubuntu-kernel-ci/scripts/package_kernel --cfg origen-3.7.cfg

gotchya's:
	The config scripts all have nearby_git set to ~/reference-git.  You will need a symlink to an
	actuall git repo there or change nearby_git in your config to point to one.

It's just that easy (well it should be after all the bugs are worked out).  When the script 
completes there should be a directory called kernel_build.  Just cd into it and run fdr clean
(fakeroot ./debian/rules) and debuild:
  fdr clean
  time debuild --no-lintian -j5 -eCROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- -us -uc -b -aarmel
